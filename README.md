# BookRecordsProcessor

## Overview
BookRecordsProcessor is a Java application developed for the COMP249 â€“ Object-Oriented Programming II course at Concordia University. This project demonstrates advanced concepts in Java, including Exception Handling, File I/O, and object serialization. The application reads book records from CSV files, processes them for syntax and semantic errors, and serializes valid records into binary files for further use.

## Features
- **CSV File Processing**: Reads book data from CSV-formatted text files and validates the syntax.
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust exception handling for syntax and semantic errors in book records.
- **Data Serialization**: Serializes syntactically and semantically valid book records into binary files.
- **Deserialization and Navigation**: Deserializes book objects from binary files and allows users to navigate through these records.

## Installation
To run this application, ensure you have Java installed on your system. Clone the repository, navigate to the source directory, and run the main Java file.

## Documentation
All classes and methods are documented using JavaDoc standards for easy understanding and maintenance.

## Contributing
This project was developed as part of an academic assignment. While it is not open for contributions, feedback and suggestions are always welcome.
